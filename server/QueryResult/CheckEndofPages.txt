Will you be able to proactively have difficult conversations early on, or will you prefer the customer to figure it out on their own or to let someone more senior handle it? Will your client seek out your opinion on strategic initiatives because they see you as a trusted advisor, or will they see you as the person that helps complete various status updates?
