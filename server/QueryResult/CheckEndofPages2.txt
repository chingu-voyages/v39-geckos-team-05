Affirm, Inc. proudly includes Affirm, PayBright, and Returnly.Affirm is reinventing credit to make it more honest and friendly, giving consumers the flexibility to buy now and pay later without any hidden fees or compounding interest.The Compute team builds the runtime platform, frameworks and infrastructure that engineers at Affirm rely on to launch, operate and deliver high quality consumer products and services spanning multiple merchants, b2c ecosystems, partners and vendors across the globe. The team is building powerful new features on top of Kubernetes and AWS that allow Affirm’s engineering teams to define, provision, test, deploy, manage and operate reliable, observable and secure services. Such a platform will enable our teams to adapt to various technical and business challenges - from scaling for customers and merchants, expanding internationally, handling massive traffic surges, serving ML models, fighting fraud and more. The Compute team plays a crucial role in powering Affirm’s growth, by owning one of the most critical pieces in our technical infrastructure and by contributing significantly to our engineering goals around Availability, Observability, Developer Productivity and Cost.The Compute team is part of Affirm’s Platform & Infrastructure Engineering organization which provides shared infrastructure and frameworks for the Product engineering teams. The organization’s goals are to build and provide software, systems and tools that allow the rest of engineering to produce and deploy software that is scalable, reliable, secure, correct, consistent, instrumented and well tested.What you’ll do Play a critical role in defining and helping to implement our Compute platform taking into account the important principles of Operability, Availability, Resilience (including full region failover)  Collaborate with other tech-leads, management, and stakeholders across the organization to design and build the roadmap for Affirm’s Compute platform infrastructure.

During normal times, we also have engineers working out of our office in New York City.For more information, visit https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/ or follow us on Twitter at @FlashpointIntel.About the role:As a Python Engineer, you will be responsible for building, maintaining, and debugging the customer-facing APIs for our platform. These APIs power our frontend portal and allow for searching and alerting on our terabytes of dark web data.You will own the full lifecycle of software development. This includes understanding the product requirements, designing a customer-first solution, writing the code, testing the code, documenting the interface, testing the integration, deploying it to production, and monitoring the deployment.Understanding the purpose of your software is important to creating a successful product. That's why you will work closely with the product team as well as cyber threat, fraud, and security experts to immerse yourself in the security domain. No matter what part of the architecture you're working on, you will understand security threats and where they come from along with who our customers are and what problems they want to solve.You will work with the following technologies:PythonElasticsearchDocker and KubernetesKongOktaOpenAPIGoogle Cloud PlatformPostgreSQLFor full stack developers or candidates that are interested in learning frontend development, there is also the opportunity to work on the frontend application for the Exposure Protection product, which is a React application.All engineering managers at Flashpoint first joined as full-time engineers and many continue to contribute code every day. Therefore, you will be working for someone who previously worked in the position you're applying for so they know what the job entails: they know the pain points, the developer priorities, and the technology stack.What you will bring:3+ years experience as a Software EngineerProficiency in PythonThe ideal candidate will also have experience in some of the following areas:Experience using AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, or other cloud-based technologiesKnowledge of Javascript and experience with modern Javascript (ES6/7) development tools (like npm, yarn, babel, ESLint and Webpack)Experience in event-driven and/or message-driven architecturesProficiency in CI/CDExperience developing or using security tools, or any type of security-oriented backgroundThe ApplicationWe understand no one wants to cater their application for every single job they're applying to. However, if you do choose to adjust your resume specifically for this application, here are some guidelines:Your resume should tell a story of how you've grown. Which roles have you had and what you learned from each of them (especially if you've learned from a mistake). Were you new to a project contributing to and improving unfamiliar code? Did you become an old hat and have to regularly transfer knowledge to new teammates? Were you a mentor or a learner? Did you drive direction or take in requirements and pump out code?It's helpful to know what technologies you have experience with as well as how much experience. The best place for this is often in a dedicated section. This way you can focus each job position on your roles and growth and not have to fit in all the languages and databases you used.All resumes are reviewed by a human so you do not need to include extra keywords to get past a \"resume scanner\".If you're a Senior Engineer, perhaps you've been involved in recruiting in the past. Think about what information you find helpful on candidates' resumes and be sure to include it.Cover letters are optional. If you decide to write one, let it show off your personality. It should reflect the voice you'll use day-to-day on our team. Additionally, feel free to mention anything that makes you a unique asset that's not already covered by your resume. You can also mention if you've changed your resume based on these guidelines.Why Flashpoint is a Great Place to Work:Diversity. Flashpoint is committed to fostering, cultivating and preserving a culture of diversity, inclusion, belonging, and equity. We recognize that diversity is key to achieving our vision. We believe that every person and their experiences contribute to building a work environment and products and services that will change the world.Culture and Belonging.

These APIs power our frontend portal and allow for searching and alerting on our terabytes of dark web data.You will own the full lifecycle of software development. This includes understanding the product requirements, designing a customer-first solution, writing the code, testing the code, documenting the interface, testing the integration, deploying it to production, and monitoring the deployment.Understanding the purpose of your software is important to creating a successful product. That's why you will work closely with the product team as well as cyber threat, fraud, and security experts to immerse yourself in the security domain.

However, if you do choose to adjust your resume specifically for this application, here are some guidelines:Your resume should tell a story of how you've grown. Which roles have you had and what you learned from each of them (especially if you've learned from a mistake). Were you new to a project contributing to and improving unfamiliar code? Did you become an old hat and have to regularly transfer knowledge to new teammates? Were you a mentor or a learner? Did you drive direction or take in requirements and pump out code?It's helpful to know what technologies you have experience with as well as how much experience. The best place for this is often in a dedicated section. This way you can focus each job position on your roles and growth and not have to fit in all the languages and databases you used.All resumes are reviewed by a human so you do not need to include extra keywords to get past a \"resume scanner\".If you're a Senior Engineer, perhaps you've been involved in recruiting in the past. Think about what information you find helpful on candidates' resumes and be sure to include it.Cover letters are optional. If you decide to write one, let it show off your personality. It should reflect the voice you'll use day-to-day on our team. Additionally, feel free to mention anything that makes you a unique asset that's not already covered by your resume. You can also mention if you've changed your resume based on these guidelines.Why Flashpoint is a Great Place to Work:Diversity. Flashpoint is committed to fostering, cultivating and preserving a culture of diversity, inclusion, belonging, and equity. We recognize that diversity is key to achieving our vision. We believe that every person and their experiences contribute to building a work environment and products and services that will change the world.Culture and Belonging.
